# Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores 


## Project Overview
Every year, school test results significantly influence the academic journey of millions of students. In the United States, particularly in the context of college admissions, standardized tests like the SAT play a crucial role. This project focuses on analyzing the test performance data of New York City's public schools, with a specific emphasis on math results.


## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to identify the schools in NYC that demonstrate outstanding math performance. Additionally, we aim to analyze how test performance varies across different boroughs and 
ultimately highlight the top ten performing schools citywide.


## Project Steps

    Data Exploration:
        Examine the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
        Identify key variables related to math test performance.

    Identifying Top Math-Performing Schools:
        Implement algorithms to identify schools with exceptional math results.
        Consider factors such as average scores, percentile rankings, and trends over time.

    Borough-wise Analysis:
        Explore how math performance varies across different boroughs.
        Visualize the distribution of scores and identify any patterns or trends.

    Top Ten Performing Schools:
        Compile a list of the top ten schools based on math performance.
        Provide insights into what makes these schools stand out.
